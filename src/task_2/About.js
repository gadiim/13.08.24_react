        <div>The town of Concord was founded in 1635; signs noting the year can be seen entering the town from the west and south. On April 17, 1775, British soldiers in the area were involved in the initiative to "quell the growing tide of revolution" under the command of General Thomas Gage. Gage had received orders from the Earl of Dartmouth four days prior to see all artillery, ammunition, provisions, and weaponry held by the colonists of Concord destroyed.</div>
